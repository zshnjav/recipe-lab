1. Crack the eggs into a bowl and whisk until fully combined.
2. Melt butter in a nonstick skillet over low heat.
3. Add eggs and stir constantly with a silicone spatula until softly set.
4. Remove from heat just before fully cooked; residual heat will finish them.
5. Season with salt and pepper, then serve immediately.

Notes:
- Keep heat low for a creamier texture.
