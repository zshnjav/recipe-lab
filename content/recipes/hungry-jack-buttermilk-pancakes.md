## Prep (Mise-en-Place)



1. Weigh mix: Add the Hungry Jack Buttermilk Complete mix (120 g) to a medium bowl.

2. Measure water and mix: Measure water (162 g). Pour in and stir 10–15 seconds—just until the big dry pockets are gone; batter should be a little lumpy. Rest 10 minutes undisturbed; do not stir again before pouring.



## Execution



1. Preheat and oil: Heat a nonstick skillet over medium-low to medium for 2–3 minutes until a drop of water sizzles and skates. Add neutral oil (1–2 tsp | 5–10 g) and swirl to coat; it should shimmer, not smoke.

2. Cook and serve: Without stirring, pour batter for 6-inch pancakes (about 60–80 g batter each, or a scant 1/4 cup). Cook 2–3 minutes until edges look set and bubbles hold shape; flip once. Cook 1–2 minutes until golden-brown and springy in the center (no wet jiggle). Serve with butter (1/2–1 Tbsp | 7–14 g) if desired; repeat, adding a touch more oil only if the pan looks dry.

Notes:

- One flip only: Flipping more than once tends to make pancakes tougher.
- Use pancake #1 to tune heat: If it browns before the edges set, lower heat; if it stays pale and slow, raise slightly.
- Butter in the pan can burn: If you cook with butter, keep heat a bit lower or combine butter with a little neutral oil to reduce scorching.
