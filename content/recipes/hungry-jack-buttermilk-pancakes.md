## Prep (Mise-en-Place)



1. Weigh the mix: Add the Hungry Jack Buttermilk Complete mix (120 g) to a medium bowl.

2. Weigh the water: Measure the water (162 g). This is 35% more water than the mix by weight (120 g × 1.35 = 162 g).



## Execution



1. Mix gently: Pour in the water (162 g) and stir 10–15 seconds—just until the big dry pockets are gone. The batter should be a little lumpy (small/medium lumps are fine).

2. Rest (hands off): Let the batter sit 10 minutes undisturbed so it can hydrate and fluff up. Do not stir again before pouring.

3. Preheat: Heat a nonstick skillet over medium-low to medium (around “40%” on my burner) for 2–3 minutes, until a drop of water sizzles and skates.

4. Oil the pan: Add neutral oil (1–2 tsp | 5–10 g) and swirl to coat; it should shimmer, not smoke.

5. Pour (don’t re-stir): Without stirring, pour batter to make 6-inch pancakes (about 60–80 g batter each, or a scant 1/4 cup).

6. Cook first side: Cook 2–3 minutes undisturbed until the edges look set and not glossy/wet and the bubbles on top hold their shape. Peek underneath—aim for golden-brown.

7. Flip once: Use a wide spatula and flip in one confident motion.

8. Cook second side: Cook 1–2 minutes until the second side is golden-brown and the pancake feels springy in the center (no wet jiggle). Pull it when the bottom color roughly matches the first side.

9. Serve: Move to a plate. Add butter (1/2–1 Tbsp | 7–14 g) if you like. Repeat, adding a touch more oil (1/2–1 tsp | 2–5 g) only if the pan looks dry.



Notes:

- *Cup amounts vary by how the mix is packed; 120 g is the reliable target.
- One flip only: Flipping more than once tends to make pancakes tougher.
- Use pancake #1 to tune heat: If it browns before the edges set, lower heat; if it stays pale and slow, raise slightly.
- Butter in the pan can burn: If you cook with butter, keep heat a bit lower or combine butter with a little neutral oil to reduce scorching.
