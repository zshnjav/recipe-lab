## Prep (Mise-en-Place)

1. In a small cup or bowl, mix 1 cup (240 ml) of water with ¾ tsp (3 g) of Hondashi until dissolved. Set aside.
2. If the 1 lb (454 g) beef slices are very long, cut them in half crosswise so they are bite-sized.
3. Peel 2 medium (300 g) onions and slice them thinly (approx. ¼ inch thick).
4. Peel 1-inch knob (15 g) ginger and grate it finely.
5. In your cold skillet or wide sauté pan, combine the prepared Dashi Stock, ½ cup (120 ml) Mizkan Mirin, and ¼ cup (60 ml) Soy Sauce.

## Execution

1. Add the 2 medium (300 g) sliced onions into the pan with the sauce mixture (Dashi, Mirin, Soy). Turn heat to Medium-High and bring to a boil. Once boiling, reduce to a simmer and cook for about 10 minutes until onions are tender.
2. Stir in the 1-inch knob (15 g) of grated ginger.
3. Dip a spoon in and taste the broth. If it is too sweet for you, add a splash more soy sauce. If it is too salty, add a splash of water.
4. Add the 1 lb (454 g) sliced beef to the simmering liquid. Use chopsticks to separate the slices immediately. Simmer gently for 2 to 3 minutes. As soon as the beef is no longer pink, turn off the heat.
5. Spoon the beef, onions, and sauce over the 4 cups (600 g) of rice. Top with scallions, pickled ginger, or an egg.

Notes:
- Since we are swapping sake for sweet Mirin, we are omitting the extra sugar entirely.
- This recipe was inspired by J. Kenji Lopez-Alt's Gyudon (Japanese Simmered Beef and Rice Bowls)
