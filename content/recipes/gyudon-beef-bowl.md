## Prep (Mise-en-Place)

1. Make the Dashi Stock: Mix 1 cup (240 ml) of water with ¾ tsp (3 g) of Hondashi until dissolved.
2. Prep the Beef: Cut the 1 lb (454 g) beef slices in half crosswise into bite-sized pieces.
3. Prep the Aromatics: Thinly slice the 2 medium (300 g) onions and finely grate the 1-inch knob (15 g) of ginger.
4. Combine Liquid Base: In a cold skillet, combine the Dashi Stock, ½ cup (120 ml) Mirin, and ¼ cup (60 ml) Soy Sauce.

## Execution

1. Simmer Onions: Add sliced onions to the skillet. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, then reduce to a simmer for 10 minutes until tender.
2. Add Ginger: Stir in the grated ginger.
3. Taste Test: Check the broth; add soy sauce if too sweet or water if too salty.
4. Cook Beef: Add sliced beef, separating slices with chopsticks. Simmer for 2 to 3 minutes until no longer pink, then remove from heat.
5. Serve: Spoon beef, onions, and sauce over warm rice.
